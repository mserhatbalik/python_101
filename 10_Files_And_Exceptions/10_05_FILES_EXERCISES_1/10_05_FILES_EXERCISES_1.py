10-1. Learning Python: Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines summarizing what you’ve learned about Python so far.
Start each line with the phrase In Python you can. . . . Save the file as learning_python.txt in the same directory as your exercises from this chapter.
Write a program that reads the file and prints what you wrote two times: print the contents once by reading in the entire file,
and once by storing the lines in a list and then looping over each line.

# print(f"{path.read_text()}\n")

# # Store every line in a list, then print them one by one
# lines = path.read_text().splitlines()

"""
10-2.	Learning C: You can use the replace() method to replace any word in a string with a different word. 
Here’s a quick example showing how to replace 'dog' with 'cat' in a sentence:
>>> message = "I really like dogs."
>>> message.replace('dog', 'cat')
'I really like cats.'
Read in each line from the file you just created, learning_python.txt, and replace the word Python with the name of another language, such as C. 
Print each modified line to the screen.

# contents = contents.replace("Python", "C")

"""
10-3.	Simpler Code: The program file_reader.py in this section uses a temporary variable, lines, to show how splitlines() works. 
You can skip the temporary variable and loop directly over the list that splitlines() returns:
for line in contents.splitlines():
Remove the temporary variable from each of the programs in this section, to make them more concise.
