# In programming, a CONSTANT is a variable which keeps its value the same throughout the whole lifecycle of a program.
# In Python, there is no in-built constant type. So Python programmers use ALL_CAPITAL letters to hint other programmers about a variable value which should not be changed.

# pay_rate=14
# total_pay = WORKING_HOURS_OF_DAY * pay_rate
# message = f"You will be paid ${total_pay} for working {WORKING_HOURS_OF_DAY} hours per day."
