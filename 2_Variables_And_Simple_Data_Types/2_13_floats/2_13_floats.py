### FLOATS ###
# Floats are the numbers which have a decimal point.
# In python any operation that uses a number with decimals (float) alongside an integer results in a float
# num1 = 3.00
# num2 = 5
# total = num1+num2
# print(total)


# Also any operation that results of dividing multiple numbers also result in a float
# num1= 35
# num2=7
# divide = num1/num2
# print(divide)
